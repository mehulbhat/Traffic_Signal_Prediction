# Traffic_Signal_Prediction
Predicting the available picture of a traffic signal, to be used in driving automation.

(**Make sure to see the Apendix file for information on the label values of traffic signals**)

We make use of convolution neural networks (CNN) and machine learning to make a classifier for prediction.
